BB-Code Parser is a bulletin-board code parsing library released under the 3-clause
BSD license and available in both PHP and JavaScript. It aims to ensure feature and
output compatability between both implementations.

Sample bb-code:
  [b]bold text![/b]
  [i]italics[/i]
  [img]http://sample.com/sample.png[/img]

The library is also configurable so it can handle non-standard (non-bb-code)
syntax, such as :smile: or :coffee: which is more like the emoticon syntax used by
many internet sites. In fact, two differently configured instances of the parser
could actually handle both syntaxes in the same text over two passes.

  [b]I :heart: bold text![/b]

By default the parser supports conversion of the following bb-code tags to X/HTML:
b, i, u, s, font, size, color, left, center, right, quote, code, codebox, url, img,
ul, ol, li, list, * (equivalent to li)


In order to keep this README short, I haven't include any usage details. Please see
the top of either the PHP or JS bb-code parser file for how to use this library.

Please note in version 1.0 the way options are passed to the constructor and format
method has changed. The last version with the old API is available as tag v.9 under
the downloads section.
